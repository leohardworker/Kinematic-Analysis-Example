# Kinematic-Analysis-Example
We will perform the inverse kinematic analysis of a robot arm with 2 degrees of freedom in 2D space. In other words, we will calculate joint angles for a specific target position.
Step 1: Determining the Target Point
In the first step, we specify the position where the robot arm aims to reach. This is expressed as coordinates in 2D space (x, y). For instance, we can choose a target point such as x = 2 and y = 2.

Step 2: Defining the Geometric Structure and Lengths
To understand the geometry of the robot arm, we need to determine the lengths of the two joints. In this example, we assume that both joints have equal lengths, denoted as l = 2.

Step 3: Inverse Kinematic Analysis
Inverse kinematic analysis involves calculating the joint angles required to reach the desired position. Trigonometric relationships are used to perform this calculation. In this example, a temporary variable named D is computed using the cosine theorem. Subsequently, the second joint angle, denoted as theta2, is calculated using the cosine theorem, and the first joint angle, denoted as theta1, is calculated using the arctangent function.

Step 4: Converting Angles to Degrees
Angles are often calculated in radians, but humans usually understand angles better in degrees. Therefore, the angles calculated in radians are converted to degrees.

Step 5: Printing the Results
Finally, by using the calculated angles, we have determined the joint angles necessary for the robot arm to reach the target position. These angles can be used to program the robot's movements.

Such calculations are used in various fields such as robotics, computer graphics, game development, and simulations. Kinematic analysis is crucial for a robot to move to a specific position accurately or for displaying simulations correctly.
